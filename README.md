# Aggie Registration Notifier

This repository contains the source code for a website created by me with the aim to help Texas A&M students get notified when the classes they want become available. This project is designed to assist users by monitoring class availability and sending alerts when a spot opens up.

### Features
- Class Monitoring: Users can input the classes they are interested in, and the system will monitor the availability.
- Real-Time Notifications: Get instant notifications via email
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to add and manage their class watchlist.
- Ease of use: All any user needs to do is input their email and the classes they want.

### Live Website
You can view and use the live version of the website [here](https://aggienotify.us).

### Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Vue: For the front-end design and user interaction.
- Node.js: For backend logic and handling database interactions
- Oracle SQL cloud database: Stores user emails and desired class information so it can be easily retrieved
- Python: There is a seperate python script that does the emailing using SMTP not included in this repository
